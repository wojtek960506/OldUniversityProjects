# OldUniversityProjects
I wanted to store my projects from the first semesters of my studies. There are some projects written in C, C++, assembler, Java and SQL. As I was not advanced in English then and I didn't know a lot about how important is to write code in English, in those projects I used Polish variable names or classes names or I just commented in Polish.
