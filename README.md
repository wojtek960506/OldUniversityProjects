# OldUniversityProjects
I wanted to store my projects from the first semesters of my studies.
There are some projects written in C, C++, assembler, Java and SQL. 
As I was not advanced in English then and I didn't know a lot about how important is to write code in English,
in those projects I used Polish variable names or classes names or I just commented in Polish.

Each project is in their own directory and in the first subdirectory of each of those main folders
there is a file README.txt with a simple description of a project.
